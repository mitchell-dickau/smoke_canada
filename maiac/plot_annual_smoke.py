"""Annual smoke frequency over Canada from the MAIAC archive, as bars.

The MAIAC counterpart to ../noaa/plot_annual_bars.py. Covers the whole record,
2000-02 through 2025-07, which means the first and last years are partial and are
drawn as such -- see below, because for this variable that matters a lot.

WHICH NUMBER THIS IS. The HMS figure sums analyst-drawn smoke AREA over each year.
MAIAC has no polygon area, but it has something with the same shape: the count of
1 km pixel-days on which the retrieval selected a smoke aerosol model. Divided by
the valid pixel-day count it becomes a frequency -- the share of everything MODIS
successfully saw that was smoky -- which is the quantity modis/README.md names for
comparing against the HMS annual series.

The raw smoke pixel-day count is deliberately NOT plotted: valid observations
roughly double in mid-2002 when Aqua joins Terra, so a raw count would show a step
that is a change in the satellite fleet, not in the smoke. The ratio divides that
out. It cannot divide out everything -- Aqua's afternoon overpass sees a different
part of the diurnal cycle -- so 2000 through mid-2002 is Terra-only and is flagged
on the figure.

AGGREGATION. Ratio of sums, never mean of ratios (modis/README.md, caveat 2):
sum both weights over all cells and all months of the year, then divide. This is
also why no minimum-weight mask is applied by default: summing the weights already
weights each cell by how much MODIS actually saw there, so a thin cell cannot shout
as loudly as a well-observed one. --min-weight is there for sensitivity tests.
