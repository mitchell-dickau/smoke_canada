"""One day of Canada tiles -> four 25 km sufficient-statistic arrays.

This is the resumable UNIT. Everything it needs is derivable from its
arguments, it writes exactly one small cache file atomically, and it deletes
its own raw HDF scratch on the way out -- so losing one to a spot preemption
costs at most a few hundred MB of re-transfer, never a month of work.
